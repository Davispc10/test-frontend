## :construction_worker: Running Locally

A Next.js application that consumes the Marvel API to display information about characters, comics, series, events, and stories.

#### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Icegreeen/test-frontend
```
#### Define environment variables
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local

MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY=""
MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

#### Install dependencies & execute web application in development mode
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Define the environment variables by creating a .env.local file similar to [.env.local.example](https://github.com/Icegreeen/my-blog.git.env.local.example)

# :postbox: Faq

**Question:** What are the technologies used in this project?

**Answer:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Styled Component](https://styled-components.com/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

**Question** Why Next.js instead of other frameworks of React out there?

**Answer** I chose Next.js in order to opt out for different rendering strategies
